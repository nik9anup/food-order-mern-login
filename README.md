A home, login and previous orders page created using MERN stack for PES Cafe, a food ordering system intended for the PESUECC Cafeteria. Say goodbye to long lines, overcrowding and hunger!

This login page was created by me as a mini-project as part of the course, Web Technologies (UE22CS242A). <br>
Front-end: ReactJS, HTML, CSS <br>
Back-end: NodeJS, ExpressJS <br>
Database: MongoDB <br>

Note: When cloning this repository, the node modules for the backend and frontend respectively need to be installed separately.
